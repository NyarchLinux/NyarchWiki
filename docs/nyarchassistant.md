## Nyarch Assistant and Newelle

Nyarch Assistant is a fork of [Newelle](https://github.com/qwersyk/Newelle). 

**Newelle** is available on [Flathub](https://flathub.org/apps/io.github.qwersyk.Newelle) and is supposed to be an **AI chatbot for Linux users in general**, while **Nyarch Assistant** has some **anime and Nyarch Linux-related things** that do not make sense for normal users.

Newelle and Nyarch Linux will **always** be up to date with each other and Newelle extensions will always be compatible with Nyarch Assistant extensions.

## Features
- **Your dream waifu, at your command**: Choose from a vast library of TTS voices and Live2D or LivePNG models to create the perfect virtual companion.

- **Terminal Command Execution**: Execute terminal commands directly through the AI.

- **Advanced Customization**: Tailor the application with a wide range of settings.

- **Flexible Model Support**: Choose from multiple AI models to fit your specific needs.

- **Extensions support**: Add custom LLM, TTS, STT, Avatars, prompts and additional functionalities with minimal python programming

## Suggested LLM and models
You are totally free to choose what models and what providers to use Nyarch Assistant with.
By default, Nyarch Assistant uses our Demo API (limited at 10req/day), that use `Qwen2.5VL-72B` for vision tasks and `llama3.1-70B` for anything else. These API are **just to showcase Nyarch Assistant**, you are supposed to **use another provider with API Key** or use a local model with **Ollama** or our builtin loader. 

If the provider you want is not supported, you can [make your own extension](https://github.com/qwersyk/Newelle/wiki/Developing-extensions) or [check the existing extensions](https://github.com/qwersyk/Newelle/wiki/User-guide-to-Extensions#finding-extensions).

- For general purposes, general knowledge, coding and role playing, `Llama3.1-70B+` models are suggested.
- If you do more programming/IT things, `Mixtral8x22B` or `Qwen2.5` models (of basically any size) are preferred.
- For roleplay only, you might like `mythomax-l2-13b`, `llama3.1-7B` or `wizardlm-2-8x22b`.

**For more information on how to setup different providers, read** [Newelle's user guide to LLMs](https://github.com/qwersyk/Newelle/wiki/User-guide-to-the-available-LLMs)
## Nyarch Assistant settings suggestions
### Maximum Privacy
With these settings, everything will be run locally and no data about you will be sent anywhere.

Since these computations require a good amount of resources, a good GPU is suggested for good performances.
#### Local LLMs
Two offline models providers are supported: GPT4All (or "Local Model") and Ollama. For instructions on how to setup them, read [Newelle Wiki - Local Models](https://github.com/qwersyk/Newelle/wiki/User-guide-to-the-available-LLMs#local-models-1).
**Using a model with Ollama is suggested as it has more fatures and generally better performances.**
For suggested models, read [Suggested LLM and models](#suggested-llm-and-models)
#### TTS
The best supported local TTS with natural sounding voices are `Vits` and `VoiceVox`. If you have a nice Nvidia GPU (RTX Series), TTS should be almost instant. In other cases, some loading time might be required.
##### VoiceVox
[VoiceVox](https://voicevox.hiroshiba.jp/) is an open source TTS engine really natural sounding for Japanese. 

Since it only supports Japanese, if you don't know Japanese, you can decide to enable translations.
###### Installing and using VoiceVox
If you have Smart prompts enabled, you can ask Arch-chan to guide you through these steps! In case you don't trust here yapping, here are the full instructions.

**Step 1**: Install docker
```bash
sudo pacman -S docker
sudo systemctl enable --now docker
```

If you have a **Nvidia GPU** and you want to use it, also install `nvidia-container-toolkit`. Also, **Nvidia proprietary drivers must be installed.**
```bash
sudo pacman -S nvidia-container-toolkit
sudo systemctl restart docker.service
```
**Step 2**: Install the docker container

If you want to use **CPU ONLY**:
```bash
sudo docker pull voicevox/voicevox_engine:cpu-ubuntu20.04-latest
```

If you want to use **Nvidia GPU**:
```bash
sudo docker pull voicevox/voicevox_engine:nvidia-ubuntu20.04-latest
```
**Step 3**: Start the containter

If on **cpu**:
```bash
sudo docker run --rm -it -p '127.0.0.1:50021:50021' voicevox/voicevox_engine:cpu-ubuntu20.04-latest
```

If on **gpu**:
```bash
sudo docker run --rm --gpus all -p '127.0.0.1:50021:50021' voicevox/voicevox_engine:nvidia-ubuntu20.04-latest
```

**You will have to start the container every time you want to use voicevox**

**Step 4**: Configure it on Nyarch Assistant settings
![immagine](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/426e73d7-b2ca-4f05-9674-fd43d06ff647)

Put `http://localhost:50021` as endpoint (or the ip/port you chosen if you host it somewhere else).
Then, close and reopen the settings to reload the voices and then choose your favourite voice.
##### Voice Cloning
You can use [this extension](https://github.com/FrancescoCaracciolo/Newelle-Voice-Cloning) to do voice cloning with TTS.
