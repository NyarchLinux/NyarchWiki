## Nyarch Assistant and Newelle

Nyarch Assistant is a fork of [Newelle](https://github.com/qwersyk/Newelle). 

Newelle is available on [Flathub](https://flathub.org/apps/io.github.qwersyk.Newelle) and is supposed to be an AI chatbot for Linux users in general, while Nyarch Assistant has some anime and Nyarch Linux-related things that do not make sense for normal users.

Newelle and Nyarch Linux will **always** be up to date with each other and Newelle extensions will always be compatible with Nyarch Assistant extensions.

## Features

- **Terminal Command Execution**: Execute terminal commands directly through the AI.

- **Advanced Customization**: Tailor the application with a wide range of settings.
